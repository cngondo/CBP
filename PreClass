What to prepare for before  coding bootcamp:

1.  Tools and Environment: 
    Ensure that you have the proper tools for writing the relevant code in the bootcamp.
    This includes the relevant softwares, OS, working environment. In addition, choose an environment that you are most
    comfortable with.
      
2.  Be alert, flexible and responsive: 
    This will enable you to gain focus on the different elements that you'll be engaged in.
    Flexibility will be handy in the sense that you'll be ready for anything that will be thrown at you.

3.  Clear your schedule:
    Your mind is the most important thing in this period. Try and reduce unneccessary distractions that will cost your attention.
    You will maximise the time here with undivided attention.

4.  Don't be a newbie:
    If you are coming to write your first line of code in day one, please, save it. You'll end up being more confused than
    you actually came in. You HAVE TO have at least an idea of what you are coming to learn after having written several
    "Hello World" apps.

5.  Don't be a "know-it-all":
    If you have had experience in any of the languages that are in the curriculum, please, don't come all ninja on day one.
    It is easier to fill an empty glass than a full one. You can always learn more.
